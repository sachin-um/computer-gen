<p> <font face="Times New Roman" font size=5> The periode of the fifth generation is 1980 till date.The fifth genaration computer system (FGCS) was an initiative by Japan's Ministry of the international Trade and Industry (MITI) begun in 1982,to create computing using massively parallel computing/ processing. 
It was to be a result massive goverment industry research  projectin Japan during the 1980s. I"epoch-making computer".
it is aimed to create an during In this generation ,VLSI teachnology become ULSI (Ultra Large Scale  Intergration) technology,resulting in the production microprocessor chips having ten milion electronic components. </font> </p>

and also,the speed is extremely high  fifth generation coputers.this generation is still  in a developmental stage.Some of these technolagies are  beginning  emerge  and be used such as voice recognization.The Al is the emerging branch in the computer science, which interperts the means and methode of the making  computer think like human bings.


and also,All of the high level languages are used in this generation. (as the examples C and C++, Java,Net etc.,)  </font> </p>

<h2><font  color=" blue"  font size=6><b> <u>Features of the fifth generation</u> </b> </Font> </h2>
<br><br>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" color= "black" font size= "5 "> The term of the fifth generation was intend to the convey of system as being leap beyond existing machines.When the history of the computer is studied ,you able to understand that the  "vacume tubes"  were used as a cicuitry and magnetic drums for memory in first genaration.then the second genaration then, "Transitors" and "Diodes" were used in the second genaration and also,"Intergreted curcuite " and "microprocessors" were used in the third and forth genarations.Then The genaration of fifth  computers are in devolopment stage which is based on artificial interligence.
the goal of the fifth genaration is to develop devicewhich could respond toa natural language input and are capble of learning and self recognizarion.
<p> <font face="Times New Roman" color= "black" font size= "5 "> <ul> <li> UlSI technology </li> <li>Development of true artificial Interligence</li> 
<li>Development of Natural Languages Processing</li><li>Advancement in Parallel Processing</li> <li> Advancement in superconductor technology </li> <li>More user friendly interfaces with multimedia features</li> <li>Avilability of very powerful and compact computers at cheaper rates</li> </ul> </p>
